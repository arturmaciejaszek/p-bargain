# Bargain

This project is meant to be the show case of my programming abilities using Angular 5.

I will deploy it once it's done. For now I believe it to be somewhere in the middle of what's it's supposed to be.
The new ideas for features keep coming thought.


# Disclaimer
I know that the architecture of the project is a bit wonky and several bad calls has been made (the worst one being not storing the user within the ngrx state) but I preferred to work with it as is for the sake of learning different approches.
