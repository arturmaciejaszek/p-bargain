This project is meant to be the showcase of my programming abilities using Angular 5.
The sole purpose being to show whatever I am employable.

# Bargain

The idea behind this app is to let users post items (most likely used ones) for quick sale.
You select a town and browse through the goods in a given location
and you can either buy it off on the spot or ignore it and never see it again
(kind of a tinder for sales).

Once you have bought something you can chat with the seller to finalize the deal on your own accord.

That's pretty much it.
